# Predicting Employee Attrition

In my previous work, I built and managed sales teams for a higher education tech firm. It was a fast-growing business, and my teams grew in both overall number and headcount per team as the company expanded. A big part of the role included partnering with Human Resources and Recruiting to plan, as best as we could, a strategy for managing my team headcounts. Hiring, onboarding and training new employees has high overhead costs, and with the rise in HR Analytics, firms are putting more resources into managing the data behind their employees. With all of this new data, can a firm build a model to predict employee attrition, and better distribute resources as a result?
